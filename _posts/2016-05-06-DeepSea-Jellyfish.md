title:  "Deep-Sea Jellyfish"
---

This jellyfish was imaged during the NOAA's 2016 Deepwater Exploration of the Marianas Trench while exploring the informally-named _Enigma Seamount_ at a depth of 3,700m (2.3 miles). While scientists have determined that this hydromedusa belongs to the genus _Crossota_ , the exact species classification is still unknown/undecided.   
  
The red-colored radial canals seen within the bell are part of the jellyfish's water vascular system used for locomotion, food and waste transport, and respiration. They appear to be connecting points for the bright yellow-colored gonads.
