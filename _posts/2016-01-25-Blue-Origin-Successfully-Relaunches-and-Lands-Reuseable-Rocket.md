title:  "Blue Origin Successfully Re-launches and Lands Reuseable Rocket"
---

On Friday, January 22, 2016, Blue Origin (owned by Amazon's Jeff Bezos) successfully launched and landed their reusable rocket _New Shepard_ for the second time. The suborbital launch system is composed of two vehicles: a crew capsule that can accommodate three astronauts and a rocket booster that is designed to vertically land after separation.  
  
The capsule was delivered past the Karman Line (100km altitude) before both parts were retuned safely to the Mojave Desert. The ability to re-use the expensive first stage rocket booster promises to drastically reduce the cost of spaceflight.
