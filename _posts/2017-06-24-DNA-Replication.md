title:  "DNA Replication"
---

For the first time, scientists at the University of California, Davis have
imaged the replication of a single DNA molecule. Replication of genetic
material occurs in all known living organisms and is the basis of biological
inheritance.  
  
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is made up of two complementary strands of
nucleotides acids famously structured as a double helix. Prior to replication,
an enzyme called _helicase_ unwinds the DNA double helix into two separate
strands (ssDNA). _DNA polymerase_ enzymes then bind to each ssDNA and begin
replicating the complement to form two copies of the genetic material.  
  
In order to visualize the replication of individual DNA molecules, scientists
used a circular piece of DNA attached to a glass slide in a flow chamber. As
the replication enzymes proceed around the circle, the resulting copy gets
longer and longer. By adding a fluorescent dye that only binds to double-
stranded DNA, it becomes possible to visualize the growing molecule using a
high-resolution optical microscope.
