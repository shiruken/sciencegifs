Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is a _polymer_ compound created from ethylene oxide monomers (C2H4O) with numerous applications ranging from industrial manufacturing to medicine. The long polymer chains interact with each other and become entangled, which allows for the  "self-pouring" behavior. The attraction between the chains is sufficient for the polymer to act as a continuous strand, so once the beaker is tipped the polymer continues to pull itself out (similar to the self-siphoning beads).
