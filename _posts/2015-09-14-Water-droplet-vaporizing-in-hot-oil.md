title:  "Water droplet vaporizing in hot oil"
---

This is a slow motion perspective view of a water droplet vaporized in hot oil. Upon contact with the bottom of the heating vessel, the water expands rapidly as it shifts from the liquid to gaseous state. This rapid increase in volume causes the bubble to over-expand relative to the pressure of the surrounding oil. The higher pressure oil collapses the water bubble, which then re-expands and starts a cycle of expansions and contractions. The non-uniform surface of the bubble is the result of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability that exists at the water-oil interface because of their different densities.   
  
_The rapid expansion of the water as it transitions from the liquid to gas state is why_ ** _you should never try to put out an oil fire with water!_**
