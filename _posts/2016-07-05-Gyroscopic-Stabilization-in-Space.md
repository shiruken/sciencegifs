title:  "Gyroscopic Stabilization in Space"
---

A _gyroscope_ is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation is free to assume any orientation by itself. This means that when the disc is rotating, the axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of the mounting because of the _conservation of angular momentum_.  
  
A CD player contains a rapidly spinning compact disc (200-500rpm) that acts as a gyroscope in the microgravity of the International Space Station. The first CD player touched by the astronaut is _off_ , so it readily tumbles in the direction of the applied force. However, the second CD player is _on_ , so the spinning disc acts as a gyroscope that stabilizes the CD player and prevents it from tumbling. If you watch the full video, you'll see experiments conducted with two and three CD players taped together to achieve a higher dimension of stability.
