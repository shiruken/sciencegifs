title:  "Cyclohexane simultaneously boiling and freezing"

The _triple point_ of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) can exist simultaneously. Cyclohexane 's triple point occurs at 6.33Â°C and 5.388kPa. This sample of cyclohexane is moving around the triple point and rapidly transitioning between the different states of matter.
