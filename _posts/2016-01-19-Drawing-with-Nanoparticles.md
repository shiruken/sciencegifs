title:  "Drawing with Nanoparticles"
---

The efficient handling and placement of nanoparticles has been a longtime problem plaguing the nanoscience field. Researchers have developed a new technique called _Bubble-Pen Lithography_ that uses a laser-created microbubble to precisely position and deposit nanoparticles.  
  
The size and location of the microbubble can be easily controlled by varying laser power and focus. When brought in the proximity of nanoparticles (in this case quantum dots), several different physical phenomena cause the nanoparticles to become attracted to the microbubble. The microbubble can then be moved to a desired position using the laser and the nanoparticles deposited simply by turning the laser off. Repeating this process allows for complex three-dimensional structuring of the nanoparticles.
