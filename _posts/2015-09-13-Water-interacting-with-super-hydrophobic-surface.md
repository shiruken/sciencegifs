title:  "Water interacting with super hydrophobic surface"
---

A material is hydrophobic when it repels water (hydrophobia = fear of water) and tends to be comprised of non-polar molecules. Since water (H2O) is a polar solvent, it does not readily interact with non-polar molecules. The beading of the colored water on the hydrophobic surface is the result of the _hydrophobic effect_ that causes the water to minimize its contact surface area by forming spheres.  
  
A _super hydrophobic_ material like the one shown here forms droplets that have a contact angle greater than 160Â° and readily slide off the surface.
