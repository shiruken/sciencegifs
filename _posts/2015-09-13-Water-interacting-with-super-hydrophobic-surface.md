title:  "Water interacting with super hydrophobic surface"
---

A material is hydrophobic when it repels water (hydrophobia = fear of water)
and tends to be comprised of non-polar molecules. Since water (H2O) is a polar
solvent, it does not readily interact with non-polar molecules. The beading of
the colored water on the hydrophobic surface is the result of the _hydrophobic
effect_ that causes the water to minimize its contact surface area by forming
spheres.  
  
A _super hydrophobic_ material like the one shown here forms droplets that
have a contact angle greater than 160° and readily slide off the surface.
