title:  "Pluto, the other red (dwarf) planet"
---

NASA's _New Horizons_ spacecraft is now only one week away from making its flyby of our former outermost planet. The final frame was taken from only 11 million miles away from Pluto. These are the first color images ever taken of Pluto and Charon, its largest moon, and confirm decades of speculation about Pluto 's true color. High resolution black-and-white intensity imagery from the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with color data from the Ralph instrument to produce the final color images.
