title:  "Müller-Lyer Illusion"
---

Optical illusions are distortions in our visual system characterized by a
perception that appears to differ from reality. There are three major types of
optical illusions: physical, physiological, and cognitive. **Physical
illusions** are caused by the physical environment, such as refraction making
a spoon immersed in water appear to bend. **Physiological illusions** arise in
the eye or the visual pathway and can be caused by excessive stimulation of
receptors (e.g. afterimage after seeing a camera flash). **Cognitive
illusions** , such as the one below, are the result of unconscious inferences
based on assumptions about how the world should look and are the most widely
known type of optical illusion.  
  
The popular **Müller-Lyer Illusion** consists of equal length line segments
with variable fin orientations, which causes the brain to misinterpret the
actual length of the line segment. A complex example of this optical illusion
is shown in the animation below. Despite the blue and black line segments
remaining static, the context provided by the fin positions tricks our brain
into interpreting it as changes in line segment length.  
  
There are two hypotheses for how exactly this cognitive optical illusion
manifests. The first relies upon our ability to judge depth based on
perspective. The fins are misinterpreted by the brain as depth cues, which
results in an erroneous assumption of a 3D scene. The second relies upon how
the brain computes perceived location using the centroid of an object's
luminance. The orientation of the fins causes a shift in the centroid and
results in a misjudgement of distance.
