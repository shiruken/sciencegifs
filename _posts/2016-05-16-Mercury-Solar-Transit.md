title:  "Mercury Solar Transit"
---

Last week the planet Mercury underwent a _solar transit_ as it passed between
the Sun and the Earth during its orbit around our nearest star. This 7.5 hour
event only occurs roughly 13 times a century, so astronomers were out in force
with specialized telescopes to capture the passage.  
  
The Big Bear Solar Observatory's 1.2-meter _New Solar Telescope_ captured what
is believed to be the highest-resolution footage of the solar transit. This
footage was combined with imagery from NASA 's _Solar Dynamics Observatory_ ,
which captured the planet's passing with much less detail.
