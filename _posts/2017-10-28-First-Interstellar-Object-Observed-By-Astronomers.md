title:  "First Interstellar Object Observed By Astronomers"
---

Astronomers have observed what they believe to be the first **interstellar**
object entering the solar system from elsewhere in our galaxy. The small
asteroid or comet -- designated _A/2017 U1_ \-- is an estimated 400m in
diameter and moving remarkably fast at 25.5km/s.  
  
It was first detected on October 19th by the _Pan-STARRS 1_ telescope in
Haleakala, Hawaii, during a routine search for near-Earth objects. The extreme
orbit of the object, nearly perpendicular to the **ecliptic plane** , led
researchers to conclude that it likely originated from beyond our solar
system. On October 14th, _A/2017 U1_ passed within 24 million kilometers of
Earth (~60x the distance to the Moon) on its way back to interstellar space.
