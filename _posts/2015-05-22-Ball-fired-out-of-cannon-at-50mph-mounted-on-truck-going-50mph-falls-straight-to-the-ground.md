title:  "Ball fired out of cannon at 50mph mounted on truck going 50mph falls straight to the ground"

We know that F=ma (Force = Mass * Acceleration) per Newton's 2nd Law of Motion. Because the ball is fired out of the cannon at 50mph in the _opposite direction_ the 50mph truck is moving, the net acceleration is zero. This means the ball experiences no horizontal force after being launched and therefore falls straight to the ground (per Newton 's 1st Law of Motion).
