title:  "Simulating tumor growth"

This model depicts cancerous tumor growth. Every dot represents a cell and each color represents a particular genetic mutation. The model takes into account variations in surrounding tissue type, hence the non-uniform outward growth. You'll notice that most of the protrusions are the homogenous in color. This indicates that the most successful mutations are being propagated outwards by the growing tumor mass.
