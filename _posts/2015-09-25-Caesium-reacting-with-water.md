title:  "Caesium reacting with water"
---

Caesium (Cs) is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal that reacts violently when
exposed to water. The reaction is extremely exothermic and produces caesium
hydroxide (CsOH) and hydrogen gas (H2). The reaction occurs so quickly that it
will often shatter its container, as seen by the enormous force warping the
walls of this plexiglass box.  
  
_The caesium is initially contained in a glass vial that is shattered by the
metal rod to expose it to the water._
