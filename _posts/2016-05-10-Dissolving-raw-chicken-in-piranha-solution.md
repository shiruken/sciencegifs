Piranha solution is a mixture of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) that is used to clean organic residue off substrates. The mixture is
both an extremely strong oxidizer and acid that will destroy most organic
matter.  
  
The reaction takes place as two distinct processes with very different rates.
The first reaction involves the rapid _dehydration_ (loss of water molecule
from reactants) that results in _carbonization_ of organic molecules. The
speed at which this violent process destroys organic material resembles that
of a piranha feeding frenzy (hence the name).  
  
The second, slower process converts hydrogen peroxide into extremely strong
oxidizing agents capable of dissolving even elemental carbon. The oxidation of
carbon manifests as the gradual clearing of soot and carbon char left by the
initial dehydration process.
