title:  "Dissolving raw chicken in piranha solution"

Piranha solution is a mixture of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that is used to clean organic residue off substrates. The mixture is both an extremely strong oxidizer and acid that will destroy most organic matter.  
  
The reaction takes place as two distinct processes with very different rates. The first reaction involves the rapid _dehydration_ (loss of water molecule from reactants) that results in _carbonization_ of organic molecules. The speed at which this violent process destroys organic material resembles that of a piranha feeding frenzy (hence the name).   
  
The second, slower process converts hydrogen peroxide into extremely strong oxidizing agents capable of dissolving even elemental carbon. The oxidation of carbon manifests as the gradual clearing of soot and carbon char left by the initial dehydration process.
