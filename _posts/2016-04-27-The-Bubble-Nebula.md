title:  "The Bubble Nebula"
---

NASA's _Hubble Space Telescope_ turned 26 years old last week and astronomers released imagery of an immense bubble being blown into space by a a super-hot, massive star. The _stellar wind_ of hot gases released by the star moves at over four million miles per hour and sweeps up the cold, interstellar gas in front of it, forming the outer edge of the bubble.  
  
The Bubble Nebula is seven light-years across and 7,100 light-years away from the Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia. It was discovered in 1787 by William Herschel, a prominent British astronomer. Hubble's Wide Field Camera-3 imaged the nebula with unprecedented clarity in February 2016 and was used to create this animated flythrough.
