title:  "The Moon Crossing the Face of the Earth"
---

This series of images taken from NASA's _Deep Space Climate Observatory_
(DSCOVR) depicts the Moon as it moved in front of the sunlit side of the
Earth. The images were captured by the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera
(EPIC) on board the DSCOVR satellite orbiting 1 million miles from Earth. From
its position between the Sun and Earth, DSCOVR conducts its primary mission of
real-time solar wind monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA).  
  
The "natural color" images of the Earth acquired by the EPIC system are
generated by combining three separate exposures (red, green, and blue) taken
in quick succession. These take long enough that the Moon moves slightly
between each image, resulting in the noticeable artifact along its right edge.
