title:  "The Moon Crossing the Face of the Earth"
---

This series of images taken from NASA's _Deep Space Climate Observatory_ (DSCOVR) depicts the Moon as it moved in front of the sunlit side of the Earth. The images were captured by the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on board the DSCOVR satellite orbiting 1 million miles from Earth. From its position between the Sun and Earth, DSCOVR conducts its primary mission of real-time solar wind monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  
  
The "natural color" images of the Earth acquired by the EPIC system are generated by combining three separate exposures (red, green, and blue) taken in quick succession. These take long enough that the Moon moves slightly between each image, resulting in the noticeable artifact along its right edge.
