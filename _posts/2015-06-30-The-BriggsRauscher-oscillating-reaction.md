title:  "The Briggs-Rauscher oscillating reaction"
---

The Briggs-Rauscher oscillating reaction is one of a small number of known oscillating chemical reactions that produces striking color changes, making it great for demonstrations. The initial mixture of three colorless solutions results in an amber color before it suddenly changes dark blue. After some time, the solution fades back to amber and then continues oscillating between the two colors.   
  
The color changes occur because of a complex combination of slow and fast reactions taking place simultaneously. The negative feedback loop that causes the delay in color change is extremely rare in nonbiological chemical systems.
