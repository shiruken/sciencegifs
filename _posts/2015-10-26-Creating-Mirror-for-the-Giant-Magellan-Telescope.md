title:  "Creating Mirror for the Giant Magellan Telescope"
---

The Steward Observatory Mirror Lab is located beneath the University of Arizona football stadium and is the only facility on the planet capable of producing large-scale mirrors for our most advanced telescopes. Each mirror starts as individually placed chunks of glass that are melted down within an enormous heated chamber. The honeycomb structure allow for a more lightweight mirror while still retaining the requisite stiffness. The mirror will then be polished for _months_ to achieve the desired parabolic shape and smoothness.
