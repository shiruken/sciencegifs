title:  "Non-Newtonian Fluid on Speaker in Slow Mo"
---

A non-Newtonian fluid has very different properties compared to normal Newtonian fluids. The most common difference is its viscosity (resistance to gradual deformation under stress) is dependent upon shear rate.   
  
Oobleck is a mixture of cornstarch and water that is a non-toxic example of a non-Newtonian fluid. When pressure is applied to Oobleck, its viscosity increases. A quick finger tap on the surface will feel hard as the fluid thickens. However, slowly dipping your finger into the fluid will feel like interacting with water. When placed on a speaker, it will thicken and form standing waves in response to the lower frequency sound waves.
