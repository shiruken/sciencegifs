title:  "Non-Newtonian Fluid on Speaker in Slow Mo"
---

A non-Newtonian fluid has very different properties compared to normal
Newtonian fluids. The most common difference is its viscosity (resistance to
gradual deformation under stress) is dependent upon shear rate.  
  
Oobleck is a mixture of cornstarch and water that is a non-toxic example of a
non-Newtonian fluid. When pressure is applied to Oobleck, its viscosity
increases. A quick finger tap on the surface will feel hard as the fluid
thickens. However, slowly dipping your finger into the fluid will feel like
interacting with water. When placed on a speaker, it will thicken and form
standing waves in response to the lower frequency sound waves.
