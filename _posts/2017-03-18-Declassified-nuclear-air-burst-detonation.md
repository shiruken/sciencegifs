title:  "Declassified nuclear air burst detonation"
---

This high-speed footage of an air burst detonation was captured at the Nevada National Security Site during _Operation Teapot_ , a series of fourteen nuclear tests that took place during early 1955. This particular detonation (Turk) was the largest bomb tested during the experiment with a yield of 43-kilotons, almost three times larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The expanding fireball can be seen violently impacting the ground as a powerful shockwave hurls debris into the air.  
  
It is estimated that Operation Teapot released 24,500 kilocuries of radioiodine into the atmosphere, resulting in total civilian radiation exposures of 41 million person-rads of thyroid tissue exposure. This radiation exposure is estimated to have caused approximately 13,000 cases of thyroid cancer and 650 deaths.  
  
Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are working to catalogue, digitize, and declassify thousands of films featuring the United States' nuclear weapons tests. So far, 64 declassified films have been released on YouTube featuring footage from Operations Upshot-Knothole, Castle, Teapot, Plumbbob, Hardtack I, Hardtack II, and Dominic.
