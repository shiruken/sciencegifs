title:  "Greenland Ice Loss from 2004 - 2014"
---

This timelapse depicts the changes in Greenland's ice mass as detected by NASA's _GRACE_ satellite system. Between 2004 and 2014, an estimated **2,500 gigatons** of ice had been lost from the Greenland landmass.   
  
GRACE consists of two co-orbiting satellites that precisely measure the distance between the two spacecraft in order to make detailed measurements of the Earth's gravitational field. Since launching in 2002, GRACE has provided a continuous record of changes in the mass of Earth's ice sheets.
