title:  "Cochlear Implant Surgery"
---

Cochlear implants are surgically-inserted electronic devices that provide a sense of sound to a person who is deaf or severely hard of hearing in both ears. The implant bypasses the normal hearing process via an array of electrodes that are placed directly in the _cochlea_ to stimulate the _cochlear nerve_ based on sounds transmitted from an external microphone.  
  
This X-Ray footage shows the electrode array being inserted into a patient's cochlea while under general anesthesia. The cochlea is a spiral-shaped cavity in the inner ear and contains the sensory organ for hearing.
