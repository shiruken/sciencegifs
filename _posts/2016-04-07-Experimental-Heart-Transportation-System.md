The current best-practice for the transportation of donor hearts between
hospitals is to put it on ice inside a store-bought cooler. This severely
limits the time window for performing the transplant (~4 hours) and introduces
unnecessary risks for an already complex surgical procedure.  
  
The Transmedics Organ Care System being tested at the University of Michigan
is an investigational medical device that keeps the heart warm and beating
outside the body. This allows for much longer transportation distances and
allows the heart to be perfused with oxygen and nutrients until the patient is
ready to receive it.
