title:  "Barreleyes Fish"
---

 _Macropinna microstoma_ , more commonly known as "barreleyes" or "spook fish," is a small deep-sea fish famous for its tubular eyes and transparent head. First discovered in 1939, marine biologists have been fascinated by the unique eye design that allows for highly efficient light collection in the pitch-black environment of the deep sea.   
  
The eyes, which are capped in green and point almost straight upwards, were long thought to only provide limited upwards tunnel-vision for the fish. Recent research has shown that the eyes can actually rotate within the transparent head to look forward when necessary.
