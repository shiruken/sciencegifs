title:  "The Icy Mountains of Pluto"
---

This 360-degree visualization of the surface of Pluto was generated by a YouTuber from imagery taken by NASA's _New Horizons_ spacecraft during its recent [#PlutoFlyby](https://plus.google.com/s/%23PlutoFlyby/posts) . The three-dimensional# surface detailed was extracted from a two-dimension image using a technique called _photoclinometry_. Also known as  "shape-from-shading," it uses the shadows and light direction as reference points to construct a 3D bump map from an otherwise 2D image. Newer satellites use a two-camera (or two lens) technique called _stereoscopy_ to achieve more accurate three dimensional perspectives.
