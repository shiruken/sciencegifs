title:  "Liquid sodium-potassium alloy bullets"
---

Sodium-potassium alloy (NaK) is an _eutectic_ alloy of potassium and sodium that is usually liquid at room temperature. It is extremely reactive with water and usually requires storage in hydrocarbons or inert gases (e.g. nitrogen or argon). When exposed to air it forms a potassium superoxide coating that reacts explosively with organics.  
  
Here, the NaK alloy has been loaded into a bullet and fired at a watermelon. Immediately after leaving the barrel, the liquid metal has already ignited and acts almost like a tracer as it travels through the air. Upon penetrating the watermelon, the sodium and potassium react with the water and explodes violently.  
  
 ** _Warning_** _: The lack of proper eye protection is extremely dangerous when firing a gun or working with explosive materials at such close range. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment!_
