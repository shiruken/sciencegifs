Kingfishers are small, brightly colored birds classified within the order _Coraciiformes_ , which is a misnomer because it means "raven-like." There are over 90 different species of kingfishers located across the planet and they share similar physical characteristics: large heads, long, sharp, pointed beaks, and short legs. While famous for hunting fish, kingfishers actually consume a wide range of prey including insects, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, and spiders.  
  
This slow-motion shot depicts a kingfisher performing its signature dive into water in search of small fish. Although unsuccessful, the bird emerges from the water with a twisting motion in order to return to flight.
