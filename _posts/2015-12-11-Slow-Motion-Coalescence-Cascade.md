title:  "Slow Motion Coalescence Cascade"
---

The coalescence cascade is the phenomenon by which a droplet of water merges
together with a larger volume of water. After being gently deposited on the
surface, the droplet sits for a moment before coalescing into the bottom
layer. As the droplet merges, it results in the formation of a smaller droplet
that then undergoes the same process. The timing of the coalescence steps is
dependent upon the surface tension of the droplet and has been observed to
repeat up to six times before viscosity begins to dominate the interaction.
