title:  "Supercooling Water"
---

Two things are required for water to change between its liquid and solid (frozen) state: Temperatures below freezing (0째C/32째F at standard atmospheric pressure) and a nucleation site for the ice crystals to grow upon. If water is cooled slowly to below its freezing point in a smooth container that lacks ideal nucleation sites, it will not immediately transition into its solid state.  
  
However, as soon as the container is jostled a nucleation site can form and the entire volume will move into its temperature-appropriate state. Interestingly, if the temperature of the supercooled water was -10째C, it will almost immediately warm to 0째C as it converts from the liquid to solid state.   
  
This is the same phenomenon used in reuseable chemical heating pads.
