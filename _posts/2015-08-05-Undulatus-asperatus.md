---

Undulatus asperatus, which translates to "roughened or agitated waves," were proposed in 2009 as the first new cloud formation classification in over 60 years. These ominous-looking clouds are common in the Plains states of the United States yet often dissipate without a thunderstorm forming. This footage was recorded in Lincoln, NE, in July 2014.
