title:  "The brain during a concussion"
---

This slow motion video depicts the motion of the brain during an impact event. Concussions are the most common form of _traumatic brain injury_ and are a growing concern in many contact sports.  
  
During severe events, the cerebrospinal fluid that normally provides a cushion for the brain is unable to prevent physical collision with the skull. The pathophysiology of concussions is extremely complex and involves impaired neurotransmission, deregulation of ion gradients, energy usage, and metabolism, and reduction in cerebral blood flow.
