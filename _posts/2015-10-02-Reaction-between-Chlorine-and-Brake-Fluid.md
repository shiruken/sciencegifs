title:  "Reaction between Chlorine and Brake Fluid"

_THIS REACTION IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! DO NOT ATTEMPT!_  
  
The basic ingredients required for an explosive reaction are an oxidizer and a fuel. This reaction combines commercially available pool chlorine (calcium hypochlorite) as the oxidizer and brake fluid (polyethylene glycol) as the fuel. Upon mixture, the reaction takes several seconds to initiate. As it progresses, an immense amount of energy is released as the oxidizer consumes all the fuel. The heat is sufficient to melt the plastic bottle and produces highly flammable toxic gases that eventually ignite in a flash of light. Calcium hypochlorite is converted into calcium chloride (salt) as it oxidizes the polyethylene glycol.   
  
It is believed that the polyethylene glycol undergoes molecular fragmentation into the organic molecules ethylene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. Just 10mL of brake fluid can produce an estimated 4L of flammable gases that are readily ignited by the heat of the oxidation reaction. The other components of brake fluid undergo other (unknown) reactions, likely facilitated by the energy released from the oxidation reaction.
