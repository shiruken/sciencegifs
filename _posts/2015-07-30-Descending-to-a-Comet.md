title:  "Descending to a Comet"
---

On November 12, 2014, the European Space Agency's _Philae_ lander became the first spacecraft to successfully soft land on a comet. Despite complications with the landing that left the probe unable to utilize its solar panels for power, significant scientific discoveries were still made. Today the team published seven studies in _Science_ covering topics such as surface firmness, the composition of the comet 's interior, and the discovery of organic molecules.
