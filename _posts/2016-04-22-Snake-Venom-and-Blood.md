title:  "Snake Venom and Blood"
---

The saw-scaled viper ( _Echis carinatus_ ) is a venomous viper species found in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia that is responsible for causing the most venom-related deaths in the world. While their venom isn't the most toxic, they are extremely aggressive and are predominantly located in regions of the world without anti-venom extensive medical capabilities.  
  
When a few drops of venom is introduced into a sample of blood, it immediately causes the rupturing of red blood cells (hemolysis) and triggers the _coagulation cascade_. This causes a clot to form and makes the blood thicken into a more jelly-like substance. In the body, a loss of blood flow can result in serious injury and death very quickly if left untreated.
