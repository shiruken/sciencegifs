title:  "Motor protein traversing a microtubule"
---

Kinesin is a motor protein found in eukaryotic cells that helps transport
cargo during critical cellular functions such as mitosis and meiosis. This
animation depicts the proposed "hand-over-hand" walking mechanism by which the
protein traverses a microtubule while carrying a cargo vesicle. The seesaw
motion is caused by conformational changes during the binding and hydrolysis
of the high-energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Because microtubules
are polar, motor proteins are only capable of traveling in a specific
direction. Most kinesins move from the center of the cell towards the
periphery.
