title:  "The assembly of the International Space Station"
---

The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest artificial object in orbit around the planet and frequently visible to the naked eye. It is also the most expensive object ever built by humanity with a price tag of more than $150 billion USD.  
  
The first component was launched in 1998 and the space station is still under construction. To date there have been more than 159 components installed during more than 1,000 hours of EVAs (spacewalks). The station has been continuously occupied for over 14 years since _Expedition 1_ arrived on November 2, 2000.
