title:  "The Size of Stars"
---

The Sun's radius (695,500km) is approximately 110x larger than that of the Earth (6,367km). But compared to other stars in the cosmos, even the Sun looks tiny. One of the largest known stars is VY Canis Majoris, which has a radius of 987,600,000km (1420x the Sun). That means its total volume is **2.86 billion** times larger than the Sun. VY Canis Majoris is so large it would engulf all the planets up to and including Jupiter.
