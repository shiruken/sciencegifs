title:  "The World's Most Powerful Rocket"
---

On Tuesday, +[SpaceX](https://plus.google.com/104512038508075599339) successfully launched the **Falcon Heavy** from Cape Canaveral and claimed the title of most powerful rocket currently in operation. Its 27 Merlin 1D engines provide a total of 22,819 kN of thrust at launch, allowing it to carry up to 63,800 kg of payload to low Earth orbit. This ranks as the fourth highest capacity rocket ever built after the Saturn V (140,000 kg), Energia (100,000 kg), and N1 (95,000 kg). However, the ability to reuse the first stage and booster rockets will make the Falcon Heavy considerably cheaper to operate. While the Falcon Heavy was originally designed to carry humans back to the Moon and eventually Mars, it will be limited to launching large satellite payloads for the foreseeable future.
