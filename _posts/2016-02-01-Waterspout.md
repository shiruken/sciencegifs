title:  "Waterspout"

A waterspout is an intense columnar vortex that occurs over a body of water.
They most commonly appear as funnel-shaped clouds connected to a cumuliform or
cumulonimbus cloud. Only the strongest versions that spawn from mesocyclones
(like land-based tornados) actually suck up water. Waterspouts are most
commonly seen in tropical and sub-tropical climates. The Florida Keys average
400+ observations annually.
