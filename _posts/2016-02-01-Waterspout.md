title:  "Waterspout"
---

A waterspout is an intense columnar vortex that occurs over a body of water. They most commonly appear as funnel-shaped clouds connected to a cumuliform or cumulonimbus cloud. Only the strongest versions that spawn from mesocyclones (like land-based tornados) actually suck up water. Waterspouts are most commonly seen in tropical and sub-tropical climates. The Florida Keys average 400+ observations annually.
