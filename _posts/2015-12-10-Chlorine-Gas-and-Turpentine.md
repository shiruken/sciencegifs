title:  "Chlorine Gas and Turpentine"
---

The reaction between chlorine gas (Cl2) and turpentine (C10H16) is exothermic and extremely dangerous because of both the reactants and products. The yellow-green chlorine gas in the Erlenmeyer flask reacts to form hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) and elemental carbon (C), which produces the jet black color.  
  
 **WARNING: This experiment is extremely dangerous and should never be performed without proper safety equipment. The creator of the source video put themselves at risk by failing to wear gloves.**
