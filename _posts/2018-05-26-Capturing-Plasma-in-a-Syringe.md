title:  "Capturing Plasma in a Syringe"
---

The **Tesla Coil** is an electrical circuit invented by Nikola Tesla in 1891 that is used to produce high-voltage, low-current electricity. They are best known for brilliant sparking discharges caused by **ionization** of the surrounding air by the strong electric field, which allows it to conduct electricity. Ionized gases are also known as **plasma** , the fourth fundamental state of matter.  
  
Here, a syringe is being used to create a near-vacuum environment that allows the electrons to travel more easily and further than under standard atmospheric conditions. This allows the plasma to persist for much longer than normal.
