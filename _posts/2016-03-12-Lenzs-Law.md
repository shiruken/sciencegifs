title:  "Lenz's Law"
---

Lenz's Law states than when an induced current flows, its direction is always such that it will oppose the change that produced it. This means that a falling magnet will induce a current in the copper pipe (non-magnetic). This induced current creates a magnetic field opposing the changing magnetic fields of the falling magnet. This results in the magnet being repelled and falling much more slowly than a plain iron ball.   
  
Lenz's Law is a byproduct of Faraday's Law of Induction that describes how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force. Faraday's Law is in turn a core component of Maxwell's Equations that describe electromagnetism.
