title:  "Slow Motion Tuning Fork"
---

A tuning fork is an _acoustic resonator_ that vibrates at a specific pitch after being struck on a surface. Tuning forks emit a pure musical tone and were used to tune musical instruments (as its name suggests). As the vibrating tuning fork breaks the surface of the water, it sends droplets spraying everywhere.  
  
Fun Fact: The quartz crystal that serves as the timekeeping element in many watches is actually a tiny tuning fork that vibrates at a frequency of 32,768Hz.
