title:  "Electron Microscope Imagery of Vinyl LP"
---

Unlike conventional light microscopes, electron microscopes use an accelerated beam of electrons as the source of illumination. Because the wavelength of an electron is up to 100,000x shorter than that of a visible light photon, electron microscopes can resolve much smaller objects. While most conventional light microscopes are limited to around 2,000x magnification and ~200nm resolution, transmission electron microscopes can achieve up to 10,000,000x magnification and resolve objects as small as 50 picometers!  
  
A _scanning electron microscope_ was used to image the interaction of a vinyl LP with the needle of a record player. The irregularities in each groove of the vinyl represents the audio waveform for both the left and right channels of stereo audio. As the needle moves down the path, the minor deflections are converted into electrical signals and output to a speaker. Each groove is roughly 80µm wide and ranges between 35-40µm in depth.
