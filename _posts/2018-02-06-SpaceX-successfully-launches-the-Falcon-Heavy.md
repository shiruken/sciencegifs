+[SpaceX](https://plus.google.com/104512038508075599339) successfully tested its new **Falcon Heavy** launch system earlier today by propelling a dummy payload of founder Elon Musk 's +[Tesla](https://plus.google.com/110107458243955110887) Roadster into orbit around the Sun. The Falcon Heavy consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 rocket core with two Falcon first stages as strap-on boosters. All three rockets are reusable and designed to land vertically after separating from the delivery vehicle.  
  
Here, the two Falcon 9 boosters can be seen landing simultaneously in Cape Canaveral, FL. The central core was supposed to land on a remote drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean but all signs indicate it was likely lost during re-entry. Despite this, the maiden flight of the Falcon Heavy was declared a resounding success and promises to usher in a new era of cheaper orbital delivery costs.
