title:  "First Imagery from GOES-17"
---

On March 1, 2018, NASA and NOAA successfully launched **GOES-17** , the second
in a new series of four highly advanced geostationary weather satellites. Once
positioned in its final orbit, the satellite will be renamed **GOES-West** and
provide coverage of the American continent and much of the Pacific Ocean.  
  
This short sequence contains the first images captured by the **Advanced
Baseline Imager** (ABI) on board the satellite. It combines imagery from two
visible and one infra-red spectral bands to form a  'GeoColor' composite. The
new generation of GOES is capable of viewing the Earth across 16 spectral
bands and provides 4x the spatial resolution and more than 5x faster coverage
than its predecessor.  
  
Unfortunately, the ABI on GOES-17 encountered cooling issues after deployment
that severely impairs the performance of 13 near-infrared and infrared
spectral bands. It's unclear what caused the issue and whether it can be
resolved.
