title:  "Slow Motion Barking Dog Reaction"
---

The Barking Dog reaction is a popular chemistry demonstration that produces a loud 'woof' noise similar to the sound of a dog's bark (check out the source video). The exothermic reaction involves igniting a mixture of carbon disulfide (CS2) and nitrous oxide (NO2) gas inside a large test tube. A brilliant blue flame is produced as the reactants decompose during combustion.   
  
The slow motion video shot at 3000fps reveals oscillations in the flame through the test tube. As the reactants combust, a pressure wave is created that travels down the tube. Upon reaching the bottom of the tube, the pressure wave is reflected back upwards, causing the flame to be pushed up. This expansion and contraction continues until all the reactants in the test tube are consumed.
