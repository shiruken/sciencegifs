title:  "Summers Are Getting Hotter"
---

Compared to a baseline period beginning in the 1950's, summers in the northern
hemisphere are becoming increasingly hotter. This data depicts the shifting
distribution of June, July, and August land _temperature anomalies_ (departure
from long-term average) over subsequent decades.  
  
The normal distribution of the 1951 to 1980 baseline data was used to define
three temperature categories (cold, normal, and hot), so that a third of the
data fell into each bin. Since then, summer temperatures have shifted
drastically such that between 2005 to 2015, two-thirds of all values were in
the "hot" category. In fact, the distribution shifted so far that a new
category "extremely hot" had to be added since almost 15% of the data exceeded
the original scale.  
  
The broadening of the distribution is also of interest since it seems to imply
that there is greater temperature variability now than in the past. However,
climate scientists suspect this is actually caused by parts of the world
warming faster than others. When the effects of regional variability in global
warming are taken into account, the increased variability in temperature
anomalies is significantly reduced.
