title:  "Centripetal Acceleration"
---

An object sitting on the Earth experiences one unit of _g-force_ via the mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground. G-force is a measurement of the type of acceleration that causes weight and is not an actual force.   
  
As this fighter jet performs a barrel roll, _centripetal acceleration_ (not centrifugal) causes around 2 units of g-force directed towards the center of the loop when the plane is completely inverted. This means that the downwards acceleration caused by gravity is overcome by the centripetal acceleration that is pointing upwards when the plane is inverted. This means that the pilot and the water is experiencing one net unit of g-force, allowing it to be poured as if sitting upright on the ground.
