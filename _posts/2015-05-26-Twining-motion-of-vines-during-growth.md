title:  "Twining motion of vines during growth"

Climbing vines require structural support during their growth. The swinging
shoot tip is believed to help the plant locate a suitable support. Upon
contact, the plant undergoes directional growth and the vine begins to curl
around the support. This process is called _thigmotropism_.
