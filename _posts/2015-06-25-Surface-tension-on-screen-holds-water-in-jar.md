title:  "Surface tension on screen holds water in jar"
---

The _surface tension_ of the water on the metal screen is sufficient to
contain the entire jar of water even while inverted. Surface tension is the
elastic tendency of liquids that makes them attempt to minimize surface area.
Obviously, without the screen present the water would immediately spill.
