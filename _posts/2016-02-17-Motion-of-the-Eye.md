title:  "Motion of the Eye"
---

The peak angular speed of the human eye can reach 900 degrees/second during quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes called _saccades_ , which serves as a mechanism for visual fixation.   
  
High-frame-rate video recorded at 700fps highlights the strong inertial forces experienced by the eye during movement. Both the iris and the liquid _aqueous humor_ filling the anterior chamber of the eye can be seen rippling as the eye comes to a sudden stop. While there are diseases and surgical procedures than can exacerbate the amount of motion, this is considered perfectly normal functionality.
