title:  "Conservation of Momentum (and Energy)"
---

When dropped individually, these balls fail to reach their initial heights because energy is lost as they impact on the ground. Because of _Conservation of Energy_ , the upwards bouncing ball no longer has the kinetic energy necessary to reach the same height.  
  
However, when stacked on top of each other, the golf ball is sent flying because of _Conservation of Momentum_ (momentum = mass*velocity). Upon impact on the ground, the basketball transferred all its momentum into the blue ball, which in turn transferred all its momentum into the golf ball. Because momentum is related to mass, these larger balls have much more momentum than the golf ball. This means that in order for momentum to be conserved, the upwards velocity of the golf ball is massively increased, sending the golfball flying high.
