title:  "Melting Styrofoam with Acetone"
---

Acetone is a colorless organic _solvent_ commonly found in nail polish remover and paint thinner. Over 6.7 million tonnes of acetone were produced in 2010, mainly for use in chemical production and manufacturing.  
  
Styrofoam is a trademarked brand name for _extruded_ polystyrene foam used primarily for thermal insulation. The name is also frequently used incorrectly to refer to the _expanded_ polystyrene foam found in disposable cups, coolers, or cushioning materials for packaging. Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics and is extremely soluble in organic solvents.  
  
When exposed to acetone, the cross-linkers between the polystyrene molecules are broken, causing the material to dissolve. Because the molecules in the expanded polystyrene foam were very far apart (hence the low weight of the cup), the dissolved material takes up much less space.
