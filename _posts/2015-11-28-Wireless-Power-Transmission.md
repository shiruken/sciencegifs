title:  "Wireless Power Transmission"
---

The wireless transmission of power is an extremely popular concept for many future technologies. This simple demonstration of _resonant inductive coupling_ shows the near-field transmission of electrical energy between two magnetically coupled coils.  
  
As the receiver coil (left) is brought closer to the transmission coil (right), the attached LED glows more brightly. However, if the coil is turned perpendicularly to the magnetic field, the transmission of energy is interrupted.  
  
The technique was first demonstrated by Nikola Tesla in 1894 by wirelessly illuminating lamps in the 35 South Fifth Avenue laboratory. The Tesla Coil was a product of his research into "electro-dynamic induction."
