title:  "Green Flash during Sunset"
---

Green flashes are an optical phenomena that sometimes occur right after sunset. In the correct conditions, a green spot briefly becomes visible above the the sun as it disappears behind the horizon. They occur because the atmosphere _refracts_ and _scatters_ the broad spectrum light of the sun differently depending on wavelength (this is why the sky is blue).   
  
In general, refraction by air (atmospheric dispersion) is larger at shorter wavelengths, which means sunsets last slightly longer for violet/blue/green light than red light. However, because the path length through the atmosphere is greatest when the sun is at the horizon, the effects of scattering are greatly increased (atmospheric extinction). Since scattering affects shorter wavelengths the most, much of the violet/blue light is lost before reaching your eye, thus leaving only the green light briefly visible.
