title:  "Hydrogels are highly absorbent"
---

A hydrogel is a network of polymer chains that are _hydrophilic_ (water-loving) and capable of holding a large amount of water. The small pile of hydrogel beads rapidly swells as the water is absorbed. Hydrogels are commonly used in biomedical research, drug delivery, and even disposable diapers.
