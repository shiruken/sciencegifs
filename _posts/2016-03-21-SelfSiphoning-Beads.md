title:  "Self-Siphoning Beads"
---

The _Mould Effect_ describes the motion of a long chain of beads released over the edge of a container. This counter-intuitive demonstration results in a seemingly self-siphoning arch of beads that defies gravity by rising upwards from the edge of the container. The phenomenon was popularized on YouTube in February 2013 by TV presenter and science blogger Steve Mould.  
  
It is believed that _Conservation of Momentum_ is the primary reason for this effect. Because all the beads are connected, the portion of the strand falling downwards must be moving at the same speed as the strand being pulled upwards out of the container. Because it 's impossible for the beads to instantaneously change direction from upwards to downwards, the strand arcs into a loop.   
  
However, whenever an object experiences a change in momentum, it also experiences an equivalent force. In this case, the momentum of turning the bend causes a small upwards force that makes the arcing strand lift upwards from the container.
