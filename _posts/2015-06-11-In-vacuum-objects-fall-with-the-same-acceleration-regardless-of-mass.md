title:  "In vacuum objects fall with the same acceleration regardless of mass"
---

In normal atmospheric conditions, air resistance plays a significant role in limiting the maximum speed (terminal velocity) at which an object can fall. However, when dropped in vacuum (no air), any dropped object will experience the same rate of acceleration, regardless of mass.
