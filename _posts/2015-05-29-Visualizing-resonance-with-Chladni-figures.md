title:  "Visualizing resonance with Chladni figures"
---

Ernest Chladni, often called the “father of acoustics,” is best-known for inventing a technique to show the various modes of vibration (resonance) of a rigid surface. By covering a metal plate in sand and running a violin bow along the edge, resonance could be visualized by the patterns that formed in the sand. These patterns are now known as _Chladni figures_.  
  
Modern-day versions of this experiment simply require a speaker situated beneath a metal plate. As the frequency of the soundwaves is increased, the sand will realign at each resonant frequency of the metal plate. The higher the frequency, the more complex the Chladni figure.
