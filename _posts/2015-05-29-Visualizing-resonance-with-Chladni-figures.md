title:  "Visualizing resonance with Chladni figures"
---

Ernest Chladni, often called the “father of acoustics,” is best-known for
inventing a technique to show the various modes of vibration (resonance) of a
rigid surface. By covering a metal plate in sand and running a violin bow
along the edge, resonance could be visualized by the patterns that formed in
the sand. These patterns are now known as _Chladni figures_.  
  
Modern-day versions of this experiment simply require a speaker situated
beneath a metal plate. As the frequency of the soundwaves is increased, the
sand will realign at each resonant frequency of the metal plate. The higher
the frequency, the more complex the Chladni figure.
