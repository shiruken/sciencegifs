title:  "Formation of a Nor'easter"
---

The northeastern United States is currently bracing for record-breaking snowfall as a _Nor 'easter_ approaches the region. This macro-scale cyclone is a cold-core low-pressure system that thrives on cold air, opposite to how a hurricane thrives on warm air. Nor'easters form as warm _Gulf Stream_ ocean current coming up from the tropical Atlantic collides with cold air coming down from Canada to form an area of intense low pressure.  
  
These weather maps from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) depict a measurement known as _potential vorticity_ , which is a useful metric for studying the formation and development of cyclones (cyclogenesis). Much like angular momentum, atmospheric potential vorticity must also be conserved in a system. Therefore, when a broadly spread vortex of air converges, its airspeed must increase in order to maintain potential vorticity.
