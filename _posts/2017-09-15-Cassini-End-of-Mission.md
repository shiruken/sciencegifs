title:  "Cassini: End of Mission"
---

At 4:55 am PDT, NASA's Deep Space Network lost contact with the _Cassini_
spacecraft as it plunged into the atmosphere of Saturn.  
  
This marks the end of a nearly 20-year-long, 4.9 billion mile mission that
began aboard a Titan IV rocket in Cape Canaveral on October 15, 1997. After
almost seven years of travel, including flybys of Venus, Earth, and Jupiter,
_Cassini_ entered orbit around the sixth planet of our Solar System on July 1,
2004, where it remained for over a decade. Earlier this year, _Cassini_ began
a series of harrowing dives between Saturn and its majestic rings, culminating
today with its destruction in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant. With fuel
running low, this method of disposal was selected to minimize the risk of
biological contamination of Saturn 's moons.  
  
 _Cassini_ is responsible for an immense body of knowledge about our Solar
System. From tests validating Einstein 's theory of general relativity to
discovering six new moons orbiting Saturn to landing the _Huygens_ probe on
the surface of Titan, the spacecraft has been a workhorse of NASA, ESA, and
ASI for many years.  
  
And now she has become one with the planet she so magnificently portrayed.
