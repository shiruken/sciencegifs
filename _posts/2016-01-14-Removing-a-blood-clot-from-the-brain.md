title:  "Removing a blood clot from the brain"
---

Thrombectomy is an emergency surgical procedure used to remove blood clots from the brain in order to prevent further tissue death because of blocked blood circulation. These surgeries are almost all performed via a catheter inserted in the femoral artery of the patient's leg. The surgeon guides the catheter through the circulatory system up to the patient's head and the location of the blockage. In this particular Covidien system, the catheter guide-wire is forced through the clot and then used to deploy a temporary metal structure. This device restores blood flow through the blocked vessel and embeds itself into the clot so that it can be removed from the body at the same time as the catheter.
