title:  "Hurricane Patricia makes landfall in Mexico"
---

Hurricane Patricia made landfall around 7:30pm ET just north of Manzanillo, Mexico as a Category 5 hurricane. It is only the second Category 5 hurricane to make landfall from the Pacific Ocean in recorded history.  
  
Prior to landfall, the Hurricane Patricia set the lowest-measured pressure (880 mbar) of any hurricane in the Eastern Pacific or Atlantic Oceans. Pressure is used as a general measure for the strength of a storm (lower = stronger).  
  
The storm had sustained winds over 200mph, making it the strongest hurricane ever recorded when ranked by wind speed. The risk for catastrophic damage along the Mexican coast is very much a concern.
