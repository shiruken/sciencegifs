Prince Rupert's Drops are beads of toughened glass created by dipping molten
glass into cold water, which causes it to solidify into a tadpole-shaped
droplet. As the glass cools from the outside in, it produces significant
compressive stresses on the surface and tensile stresses at the core of the
drop. The spherical shape of the bulbous head gives the glass enormous
strength, such that it can be struck with a hammer without breaking. However,
the tail is extremely fragile and causes the entire droplet to explosively
shatter when cracked.

YouTube channel has a series of videos examining the behavior of Prince
Rupert's Drops using high-speed cameras. Here a .38-caliber bullet can be seen
disintegrating upon impact with the head of the droplet without damaging the
glass.
