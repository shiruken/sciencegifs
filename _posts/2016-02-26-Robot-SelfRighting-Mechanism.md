title:  "Robot Self-Righting Mechanism"
---

Boston Dynamics, a subsidiary of Google's parent company Alphabet, unveiled the latest design of their _Atlas_ robot earlier this week. Atlas is a bipedal model designed for use both indoors and outdoors and specializes in mobile manipulation The robot is electrically powered, hydraulically actuated, and uses LIDAR and stereo sensors in its head to avoid obstacles and navigate terrain.   
  
The self-righting mechanism demonstrated here is important for returning the robot to its upright and standing position. Bipedal models are easier to knock over than quadruped designs. Boston Dynamics has a dedicated robot abuser who will be a major catalyst for the inevitable robot uprising following the creation of Skynet.
