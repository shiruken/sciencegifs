title:  "Refraction of light"
---

Refraction is the bending of light that occurs at the interface of two
different mediums (i.e. water and glass). The water in the glass acts as a
lens that focuses light, which is why the arrow appears to reverse itself. The
reversal of the arrow will only occur if the glass is located at least a focal
length (of the water + glass "lens") away from the arrows.
