title:  "Brain Organoid Folding"
---

Gyrification is the developmental process that forms the characteristic folds of the cerebral cortex in the brain. It allows for increased cortical surface area and therefore greater cognitive functionality within a smaller space. Studying the wrinkling and folding of brain tissue during development is critical for providing a better understanding of the brain and various disorders.  
  
Scientists have created human brain organoids on-a-chip to study the physics of brain wrinkling. These small compartments allow for _in situ_ fluorescent imaging of stem cells as they develop over the course of weeks. As the organoid grows, convolutions begin to emerge in the cellular structure. The results reported in _Nature Physics_ suggest that mechanical instabilities drive the wrinkling process as the outer regions of the organoid exhibit increased growth while the inner surface contracts.
