Earth's global surface temperatures in 2017 ranked as the second-warmest on record since 1880, according to a new analysis by +[NASA](https://plus.google.com/102371865054310418159). The global average in 2017 was 1.62°F (0.9°C) warmer than the 1951-1980 mean, falling just behind the record set last year. The measurement is accurate to within 0.1°F and takes into account the location of 6,300 weather stations and variations in measurement technique.  
  
The global increase in temperature was also accompanied by increasing extreme weather events in 2017. Many regions experienced record-breaking high and low temperatures during the year, a side effect of global warming long-predicted by climate scientists.
