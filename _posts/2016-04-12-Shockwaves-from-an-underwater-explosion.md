title:  "Shockwaves from an underwater explosion"
---

Water is highly _incompressible_ , which means it does not readily change volume in response to a change in pressure. This means that a shockwave from an underwater explosion does not dissipate quickly like it does in air and actually travels much further.  
  
In this demonstration, the three balloons are filled with air and highlight the shockwave passing through the water. Because air is a compressible fluid, the balloons are significantly deformed by the shockwave.  
  
Unlike the demonstration of a person diving underwater to avoid gunfire, escaping an explosion this way would likely result in death. While the majority of the human body is water that the shockwave would leave unharmed, there are plenty of compressible parts (e.g. air filled lungs) that would be heavily damaged by the rapid change in pressure.
