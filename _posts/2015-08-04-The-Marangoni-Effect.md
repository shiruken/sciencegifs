When paint is mixed with gasoline, the more volatile component (gasoline) evaporates at the surface. This causes the density of the liquid to become higher near the top than at the bottom, which causes a hydrostatic instability resulting in turbulence. As the liquid flows upwards, it spreads out quickly along the surface because of the lower surface tension. This happens in many places across the surface, which results in the many different plumes.
