title:  "Ferrofluid on magnetized screw"
---

Ferrofluid is a liquid that becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field and is typically composed of ferromagnetic (iron) particles suspended in oil. When exposed to a magnet, the particles align with the surrounding magnetic field. The complex orientation of the ferrofluid visualizes the magnetic field around the magnetized screw and nut.
