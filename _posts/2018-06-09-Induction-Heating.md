title:  "Induction Heating"
---

An alternating current passing through a copper coil induces a magnetic field around the coil per **Faraday 's Law of Induction**. A piece of metal placed within that oscillating magnetic field will experience the opposite effect as an electric current is induced within the metal. These **eddy currents** passing through the metal induce an opposing magnetic field around the piece of metal and cause it to heat up through a process known as **Joule heating.** The stronger the change in magnetic field, the more heat generation.  
  
When a piece of aluminum is placed within a magnetic field generated using a 1.6 kW power inverter operating at 204 kHz, it rapidly heats and eventually melts at 660 °C. The molten aluminum reaches a final temperature of 1,200 °C before the current is finally shut off.
