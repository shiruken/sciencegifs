title:  "Red Phosphorus Sun"
---

Phosphorus, like carbon and sulfur, exists in a variety of different forms that all possess the same chemical composition but have slightly different structures (allotropes). Red phosphorus is an allotrope of phosphorus that is less flammable than the notorious white phosphorus and much more stable at room temperature.  
  
A glass flask is filled with oxygen gas and a piece of red phosphorus is ignited and lowered inside. As the red phosphorus burns, it produces a cloud of phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10) that quickly fills the glass container. As the flame is obscured, the burning red phosphorus at the center makes the smoke look similar to that of glowing star.
