title:  "Electrolysis of Water"
---

Electrolysis is the use of electrical energy to drive a reaction that would otherwise have not occurred spontaneously. When a 9V battery is submerged in water, you can see the dissolved electrolytes conducting electricity between the two terminals resulting in the decomposition of water molecules. The resulting bubbles are actually hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases!  
  
If you look closely, you will notice the left terminal (cathode) is producing more bubbles than the right terminal (anode). That is because twice as much hydrogen gas is being produced compared to oxygen gas during the reaction!
