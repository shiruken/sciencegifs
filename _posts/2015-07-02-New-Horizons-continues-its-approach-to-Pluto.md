title:  "New Horizons continues its approach to Pluto"
---

This timelapse of images was taken by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager
(LORRI) camera aboard _New Horizons_ between May 28 and June 25, 2015. During
that time the distance between the spacecraft and Pluto decreased from 35
million miles to 14 million miles. Following its gravity assist maneuver
around Jupiter, _New Horizons_ is moving at 23km/s (51,000mph).  
  
_New Horizons_ is scheduled to make its flyby of the dwarf planet and Charon,
its largest moon, on July 14, 2015. This latest imagery depicts a strongly
contrasting surface dominated by a bright northern hemisphere, with a
discontinuous band of darker material running along the equator. As the
spacecraft hurtles towards its objective, each new picture represents the best
image of Pluto captured by humanity.
