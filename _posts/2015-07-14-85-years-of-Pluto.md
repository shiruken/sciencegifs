title:  "85 years of Pluto"
---

Pluto was discovered on February 18, 1930, by Clyde W. Tombaugh at the Lowell
Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Since then many pictures have been taken
but none as stunning as the incoming imagery from NASA's _New Horizons_
spacecraft. Even the mighty Hubble Space Telescope could only capture blurry
representations of the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object
orbiting the Sun.  
  
This might seem contradictory because Hubble can capture brilliant, crisp
images of galaxies thousands and millions of light years away. One has to
remember that these distant objects are immense whereas Pluto is extremely
tiny in comparison. When Hubble takes a picture of Pluto, it only occupies
about 2.5 pixels in the image whereas an entire galaxy could fill the entire
field of view!
