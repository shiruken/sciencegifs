title:  "3D Volumetric Display"
---

Holograms have been a staple of science-fiction for decades yet they are commonly misrepresented in popular culture. According to physics, a **hologram** is a photographic recording of how light scatters from an object that can be displayed in a manner that _appears_ three-dimensional. So when R2-D2 projects Princess Leia 's message in the original _Star Wars_ movie, it technically is not a hologram because it could be viewed from any orientation. What it is is a visual representation of an object in three physical dimensions known as a **volumetric display.**  
  
Researchers at Brigham Young University have created a volumetric display system that uses photophoretic optical trapping to produce three-dimensional color graphics. **Photophoresis** is a phenomenon that allows small particles in air to be captured and precisely moved using a laser. As the particle is rapidly scanned through the display volume, it is selectively illuminated using red, green, and blue lasers to create various colors. The result is a three-dimensional image in free space that can be viewed from any angle without the limitations of current holographic or light-field technologies.
