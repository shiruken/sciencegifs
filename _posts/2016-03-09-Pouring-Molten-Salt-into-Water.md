title:  "Pouring Molten Salt into Water"
---

Table salt (sodium chloride) enters its liquid state at temperatures above
1,400°F. When a crucible of molten salt is poured into a tank of water, it
causes an explosion of steam and water. It is thought that the _Leidenfrost
Effect_ is partially responsible for the first few moments of this violent
physical reaction as the molten salt rapidly boils water in its immediate
vicinity to form a sheath of steam. However, the immense heat quickly
overcomes this barrier and rapidly expands outwards causing a stream
explosion.
