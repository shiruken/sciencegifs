title:  "Used batteries bounce higher compared to new batteries"
---

As disposable batteries age, the electrolyte that separates the anode and the cathode is consumed. Electrolyte is a chemical medium that facilitates the flow of electrical charge between the two terminals. As a battery ages, the electrolyte transitions from being springy (inhibits bouncing) to becoming stiff (allows bouncing). So while battery bouncing isn't a perfect test for percent charge remaining, it should help separate that new and old battery you just mixed up.
