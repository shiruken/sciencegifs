title:  "Used batteries bounce higher compared to new batteries"
---

As disposable batteries age, the electrolyte that separates the anode and the
cathode is consumed. Electrolyte is a chemical medium that facilitates the
flow of electrical charge between the two terminals. As a battery ages, the
electrolyte transitions from being springy (inhibits bouncing) to becoming
stiff (allows bouncing). So while battery bouncing isn't a perfect test for
percent charge remaining, it should help separate that new and old battery you
just mixed up.
