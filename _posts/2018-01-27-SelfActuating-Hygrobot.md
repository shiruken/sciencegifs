title:  "Self-Actuating Hygrobot"
---

Scientists have harnessed the power of humidity to create self-locomotive microrobots called hygrobots. This actuator-ratchet system was inspired by motile plants and uses a hygroscopic-responsive film of aligned nanofibers that swell and shrink in response to changes in humidity.  
  
As the relative humidity of the surrounding air oscillates between 20 and 85%, the structure of the bilayer actuator abruptly changes. Directional ratcheted locomotion is achieved because of differences in the friction coefficients of the end tip and knee of the legs.
