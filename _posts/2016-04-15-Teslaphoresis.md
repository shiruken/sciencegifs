title:  "Teslaphoresis"
---

Researchers at Rice University have discovered that the strong field emitted by a Tesla coil causes carbon nanotubes to self-assemble into long wires. This phenomenon has been named "teslaphoresis" and could help pave the way for the scalable assembly of nanotubes.  
  
In addition to forming a circuit between two LEDs, the nanowires are also capable of harvesting energy from the emitted electromagnetic field to illuminate them. While the field from the Tesla coil is currently limited to only a few feet, patterned surfaces and multiple coils could create much more complex nanowire patterns.
