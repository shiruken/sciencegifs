title:  "Teslaphoresis"
---

Researchers at Rice University have discovered that the strong field emitted
by a Tesla coil causes carbon nanotubes to self-assemble into long wires. This
phenomenon has been named "teslaphoresis" and could help pave the way for the
scalable assembly of nanotubes.  
  
In addition to forming a circuit between two LEDs, the nanowires are also
capable of harvesting energy from the emitted electromagnetic field to
illuminate them. While the field from the Tesla coil is currently limited to
only a few feet, patterned surfaces and multiple coils could create much more
complex nanowire patterns.
