title:  "Cassini's 'Inside-Out' View of Saturn's Rings"
---

This stunning footage from NASA's _Cassini_ spacecraft depicts a never-before-seen perspective of Saturn 's majestic rings. _Cassini_ captured the images from within the narrow gap between the planet and its rings during one of the orbital dives in its Grand Finale mission.  
  
This coming Friday, September 15th, _Cassini_ will be sent plunging into Saturn 's atmosphere where it will be destroyed by the intense heat of atmospheric reentry. This method of disposal was selected to minimize the risk of biological contamination of Saturn's moons. Data pertaining to atmospheric composition will be transmitted until the very end.  
  
 _Cassini_ is responsible for an immense body of knowledge about our Solar System. From tests validating Einstein 's theory of general relativity to discovering seven new moons orbiting Saturn to landing the Huygens probe on the surface of Titan, the spacecraft has been a workhorse of NASA, ESA, and ASI for well over a decade.
