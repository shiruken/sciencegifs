title:  "The Huge Hexagon-Shaped Storm on Saturn"
---

An enormous hexagon-shaped hurricane roars above the north pole of the planet Saturn. The swirling winds of ammonia and hydrogen extend over 60 miles deep and could engulf four Earths at the surface. The unique shape is caused by the rotation of a narrow jet stream around the north pole that causes eddies (mini storms) that shape the six-sided pattern.   
  
The storm was first seen by the Voyager spacecraft when they passed by in the early 1980's. The rotation of the planet has since cast the north pole into darkness, severely limiting our ability to image the storm from Earth. In early 2009, the Cassini spacecraft passed between Saturn and its rings and captured this incredible imagery.
