title:  "Burning Iron in Liquid Oxygen"
---

Dropping a piece of burning iron wool into liquid oxygen produces a violent chemical reaction. Almost all of the iron is consumed in the _exothermic_ reaction with oxygen to produce a mixture of iron oxides. The small pieces of iron particulates glow brightly as the reaction proceeds.   
  
The reaction is a little contradictory since liquid oxygen is extremely cold (-186Â°C) and the burning metal is extremely hot. One would expect the metal to cool upon coming into contact with the liquid yet in reality it actually heats up as the reaction begins.
