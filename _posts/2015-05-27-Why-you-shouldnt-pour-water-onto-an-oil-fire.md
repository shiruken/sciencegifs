title:  "Why you shouldn't pour water onto an oil fire"
---

The smoke point of canola oil is 400°F while the boiling point of water is only 212°F. Therefore when water is poured onto oil it sinks (higher density) and immediately boils. The resulting steam forces the burning oil upwards and causes a fireball to explode out of the pot.
