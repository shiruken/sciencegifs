title:  "A bacterium on a diatom on an amphipod"
---

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a powerful imaging technique that
produces images of a sample by scanning it with a beam of electrons instead of
light. The electrons interact with the atoms in the sample to produce signals
containing information about the sample's surface topology and composition.
Because electrons are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, SEM
can achieve resolutions better than 1 nanometer (100,000x thinner than human
hair).  
  
Here, an SEM is used to zoom in on a prepared sample by several orders of
magnitude. The microscope initially reveals an amphipod, a type of shell-less
crustacean (1mm). As it zooms in on the head of the amphipod, a round, silica-
shelled algae called a diatom is revealed (100µm). As it zooms in even
further, a rod-shaped bacterium can be seen resting on the diatom (500nm).
