title:  "The Pharaoh's Serpent"
---

Mercury(II) thiocyanate is a white powder formerly used in pyrotechnics to produce the effect known as the _Pharaoh 's Serpent_. This name stems from the large, winding "snake" of carbon nitride that forms when the powder is ignited. The toxicity of the powder and its combustion byproducts eventually ended its use in pyrotechnic displays.
