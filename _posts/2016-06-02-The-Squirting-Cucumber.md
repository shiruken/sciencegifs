title:  "The Squirting Cucumber"
---

_Ecballium elaterium_ , also known as the Squirting Cucumber, is a flowering plant native to Europe and northern Africa. Its name stems from its unique method of violently releasing seeds when ripe via a stream of liquid. The internal pressure causes the fruit to disconnect from the main plant and launches the seeds outwards. The plant and its fruit are both poisonous and was considered to be an abortifacient in the ancient world.
