title:  "30th Anniversary of the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster"
---

73.162 seconds after takeoff from Cape Canaveral, FL, on January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle _Challenger_ broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean. Disintegration of the vehicle began after the failure of an O-ring seal in the right solid rocket booster. All seven of its crew members perished:  
  
\- Francis R. Scobee, Commander  
\- Michael J. Smith, Pilot  
\- Donald McNair, Mission Specialist  
\- Ellison Onizuka, Mission Specialist  
\- Judith Resnik, Mission Specialist  
\- Gregory Jarvis, Payload Specialist  
\- Christa McAuliffe, Payload Specialist  
  
After a lengthy investigation by the Rogers Commission, NASA's organizational culture and decision-making processes were identified as key contributing factors to the accident. Flaws in the O-ring design were known at the time but had been improperly addressed and warnings about the risk of a low-temperature launch ignored. The disaster led to a 32-month hiatus of the Space Shuttle program.
