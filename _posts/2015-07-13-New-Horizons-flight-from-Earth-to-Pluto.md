title:  "New Horizon's flight from Earth to Pluto"
---

After over 9 years of travel, NASA's _New Horizons_ spacecraft will finally
perform its flyby of Pluto tomorrow morning. The first close-up photos of the
dwarf planet and now-confirmed largest object in the Kuiper Belt will be
anxiously awaited by the entire team on Earth. When launched in January 19,
2006, the spacecraft set a record 36,373mph for the highest launch speed of a
human-made object from Earth. On February 28, 2007, _New Horizons_ passed
Jupiter during a gravity assist to further increase the speed another
9,000mph.  
  
At the time of posting, the spacecraft was only a measly 480,000 miles away
(compared to the 4.87 billion miles between Earth and Pluto). After passing
Pluto the spacecraft will continue its extra-solar trek by studying other
Kuiper Belt objects. Be sure to check out NASA's live coverage of the event
tomorrow!
