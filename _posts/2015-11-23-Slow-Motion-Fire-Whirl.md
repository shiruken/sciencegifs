title:  "Slow Motion Fire Whirl"
---

Fire Whirls (also known as Fire Tornados) are whirlwinds made up of flame and ash that are induced by intense fire and turbulent wind conditions. This Slow Mo Guys video uses angled box fans to swirl a kerosene fire into a vertical column of flame. Naturally occurring fire whirls can last for hours, have wind speeds reaching 100mph, and are impossible to extinguish because of the intense surrounding fire. In 1923, the city-wide firestorm after the Great Kantō earthquake in Japan resulted in catastrophic fire whirls directly responsible for significant loss of life.
