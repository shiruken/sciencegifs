title:  "Cavitation causing the bottom of a bottle to shatter off"
---

After being struck on the top, the bottle easily moves downwards while the water does not (greater inertia). This results in a near-vacuum forming at the bottom of the bottle (the bubbles) followed by the water collapsing inwards in a process called _inertial cavitation_. The resulting shockwave causes the glass to shatter.
