title:  "Orographic Clouds over Mount Fuji"

The _lifted condensation level_ is the height at which the relative humidity of air reaches 100% and allows for the formation of cloud droplets via condensation. This occurs because the relative humidity of air increases when cooled since the amount of water vapor remains constant but the _saturation vapor pressure_ decreases exponentially with temperature.  
  
Orographic clouds are a special example of the lifted condensation level that occurs as humid air blows over a mountain. Because the air must rise to go over the mountain, it often begins to condensate and forms clouds. However, since the air quickly sinks on the leeward side of the mountain, the clouds are short-lived and rapidly evaporate back into water vapor.
