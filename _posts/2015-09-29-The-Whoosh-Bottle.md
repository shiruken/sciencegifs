title:  "The Whoosh Bottle"
---

The Whoosh Bottle is a classic classroom science demonstration of the energy released during combustion. A small volume of alcohol (ethanol, methanol, propanol) is poured into a polycarbonate bottle, which is then sealed to contain the vaporizing liquid. After a short wait, the stopper is removed and a flame placed near the opening to ignite the alcohol fumes. The name "Whoosh Bottle" comes from the roaring sound produced as the flame works its way through the bottle consuming all the vaporized alcohol.
