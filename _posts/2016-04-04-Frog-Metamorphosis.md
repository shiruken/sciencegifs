title:  "Frog Metamorphosis"
---

This timelapse depicts the metamorphosis of the African Clawed Frog ( _Xenopus levus_ ) from its tadpole larval stage to its final adult form. Metamorphosis is the biological process by which an animal develops physically after birth or hatching. The change occurs abruptly and causes significant alterations to the organism's physiology, behavior, and nutrition. In the case of frogs and toads, gills are replaced by lungs allowing the adult organism to venture beyond the confines of an aquatic environment.
