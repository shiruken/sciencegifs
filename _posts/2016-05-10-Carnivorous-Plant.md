 _Drosera capensis_ , more commonly known as the Cape Sundew, is a carnivorous plant native to the Cape in South Africa. Its leaves are covered in brightly-colored tentacles that secrete a sticky mucilage that traps insects. When an insect gets stuck, the leaves roll lengthwise towards the center (thigmotropism) over the course of tens of minutes. This accelerates digestion by increasing the surface area of digestive glands in contact with the prey.
