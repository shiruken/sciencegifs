title:  "Jellyfish sting under microscope"
---

This close-up of a jellyfish tentacle shows its stinger mechanism in action. When a small voltage is applied to the tentacle under the microscope, it triggers the firing of cnidocytes (nematocytes). A _cnidocyte_ is an explosive cell containing one large secretory organelle filled with venom and a long hollow tubule. Upon firing, the hollow tubule is pushed outwards and penetrates into the prey/predator, where it delivers its toxic payload. Normally the firing of the cnidocyte is completely involuntary and happens simply from contact with the tentacle.
