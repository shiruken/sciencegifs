title:  "Elephant Toothpaste"
---

The Elephant Toothpaste experiment earned its name from the foamy byproduct of the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Mixing yeast with hydrogen peroxide catalyzes its decomposition into water and oxygen gas via an exothermic reaction. Adding some dish soap causes the explosion of foam! This is a great experiment to try at home since the only byproducts are water, oxygen, and soap.
