title:  "Fluorescein"
---

Fluorescein is a dark orange synthetic organic compound that is widely used as a fluorescent tracer dye. When dissolved in water or alcohol, it gains the ability to fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light (494nm absorption maxima). The resulting fluorescence has an emission maxima around 512nm (green light). If the local concentration of fluorescein becomes too high, it will actually self-quench and result in a murky yellow emission. This can be seen occurring at the bottom of the glass.  
  
Fluorescein is also known as the color additive _Yellow No. 7_ , is used to dye antifreeze green, and was used to dye the Chicago River green on St. Patrick's Day.
