title:  "SpaceX Falcon 9 barge landing failure"
---

SpaceX failed for a third time to successfully land their Falcon 9 first stage rocket on a remotely operated barge. While they recently demonstrated the ability to land the rocket vertically on land, their latest seaborn attempt ended in RUD (Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly).  
  
The failure is attributed to a malfunctioning lockout collet in one of the four landing legs that allowed the rocket to tip over after touchdown. The reason for that failure is still unknown but could be ice buildup due to condensation of fog during liftoff.
