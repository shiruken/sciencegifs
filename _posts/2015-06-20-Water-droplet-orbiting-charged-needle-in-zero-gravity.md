title:  "Water droplet orbiting charged needle in zero gravity"
---

Astronauts in the International Space Station used knitting needles and water droplets to demonstrate physics in space. By applying a charge to the needle, the electrical attraction between the needle and water molecules described by _Coulomb 's Law_ causes the droplet to orbit around the needle. Since the experiment was conducted in the zero gravity environment of the ISS, there is little effect from gravity on the water molecule's motion.
