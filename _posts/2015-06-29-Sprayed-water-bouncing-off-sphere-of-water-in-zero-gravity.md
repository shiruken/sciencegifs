title:  "Sprayed water bouncing off sphere of water in zero gravity"
---

When exposed to zero gravity, _surface tension_ causes water to form a sphere. The surface tension also causes the water to resist changes in its shape. As water is sprayed from a dropper towards the larger sphere, many of the drops bounce off the sphere rather than merge. This is because the force of the water droplet is less than the surface tension of the bubble and therefore unable to penetrate and merge with the larger sphere.
