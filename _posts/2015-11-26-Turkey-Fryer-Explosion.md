title:  "Turkey Fryer Explosion"
---

Deep-frying turkey is a popular cooking method across the United States because it takes a relatively short amount of time to cook compared to roasting. However, every year there are many explosions and fires caused by improper use of the deep fryer.  
  
The most common causes for these fires is overfilling the pot and failing to thaw a frozen turkey. Many people forget to account for the displacement of the boiling oil when the turkey is introduced to the pot, which results in oil spilling out of the pot onto the open flame.  
  
An improperly thawed or wet turkey can result in a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE). Water coming into contact with the boiling oil will immediately vaporize and rapidly expand outwards, spraying oil everywhere. This has a similar effect to dumping water on an oil fire (don't do it).  
  
 _Always be sure to have the appropriate fire extinguisher present._
