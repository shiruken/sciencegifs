title:  "Explosion of SpaceX Falcon 9 shortly after launch"
---

SpaceX CRS-7 exploded after launch today on its way to the International Space Station for a cargo resupply mission. The Falcon 9 rocket exploded 2:19 after launch shortly after going supersonic at an altitude of 44km (27 miles). It was the first failure of the Falcon 9 rocket type after 19 successful launches with debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean. The payload included a docking adapter for the ISS to convert an existing docking interface into the new NASA Docking System for future US human-transport spacecraft.
