title:  "Basilisk running across water"
---

The basilisk, also called the Jesus Lizard, is capable of running across the surface of water for brief distances. Found in Central and South American rainforests near rivers, it uses this technique to find prey and escape predators. Its large hind feet have scaly fringes that extend outwards to increase surface area and allow the lizard to dart up to 20m without sinking.
