title:  "Formation of a Tornado"
---

Tornadoes are violently rotating columns of air that typically form from the base of a cumuliform cloud and extend downwards to the surface of the earth. They form within mesocyclones (area of organized rotation) commonly found in supercell thunderstorms. The convergence of cool, moist air in the downdraft with warm air in the updraft causes the initial rotation.   
  
Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110mph, reach a diameter around 250ft, and only travel a few miles before dissipating. Extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds upwards of 300mph, stretch more than two miles in diameter, and cause devastation for dozens of miles. Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except for Antarctica with the majority occurring in the "Tornado Alley" region of North America.
