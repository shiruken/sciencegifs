title:  "Proton collision in the Large Hadron Collider"
---

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider and the largest single machine on the planet. Built by CERN between 1998 and 2008, it resides within a 27km (17mi) circular tunnel 175m (574ft) beneath the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland. Over 10,000 scientists and engineers from 100+ countries were involved in the design, construction, and use of the collider.   
  
The LHC allows physicists to test the predictions of different particle physics theories and to study high-energy physics. This animation shows an actual proton collision event in 2010 detected by ATLAS, one of seven particle detectors built into the LHC. Protons are accelerated up to 99.9999991% the speed of light in the main LHC ring. By smashing together protons moving in opposite directions at extremely high speeds, it becomes possible to study massive particles previously not observable with lower-energy accelerators.
