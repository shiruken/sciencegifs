title:  "Testing first electromagnetic catapult on aircraft carrier"
---

Many aircraft require external assistance to take off from the short runway of an aircraft carrier. Historically, a pressurized steam system has been utilized to pull a plane down the track to allow it to achieve takeoff speed. The U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford is currently testing the first electromagnetic launching system for the U.S. Navy. The new system uses a _linear induction motor_ , which uses electric currents to generate magnetic fields that propel the aircraft (or cart in this case) down the track. The electromagnetic launch system offers gradual control over the acceleration and promises to reduce the cost of maintenance.
