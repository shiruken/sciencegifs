title:  "Vibrating (and recording) water stream at same frequency"
---

This fantastic demonstration of _aliasing_ uses a falling stream of water being vibrated at 24Hz by a speaker. Since the video is being recorded at 24fps, the water appears to be standing still.  
  
Adjusting the speaker frequency up to 25Hz would make the water appear to slowly fall downwards whereas reducing it to 23Hz would make it appear to be falling upwards.  
  
Aliasing is the same phenomenon that causes tire rims to appear stationary or move backwards.
