---

This map from the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research depicts the global propagation of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami that devastated parts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and India. Over 230,000 people were killed by the tsunami caused by a magnitude 9.3 earthquake (3rd largest ever recorded) off the coast of Sumatra. The tsunami inundated coastal communities with waves crested up to 100ft high and is considered one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history.
