title:  "Radioactive gas injected into cloud chamber depicts radioactive decay"
---

A _cloud chamber_ is a sealed container containing supersaturated water or alcohol vapor that can be used to detect ionizing radiation. The radioactive gas is an isotope of Radon (Rn-220) that decays into Polonium and then Lead. The v-shaped trails are produced by two alpha particles (Helium-4 nuclei) that are emitted during the two decay events.
