title:  "Mechanical Snake"
---

Researchers in Norway have developed the Eelume, a sea-snake inspired mechanical robot designed to reside on the sea floor to monitor and adjust underwater equipment. Such tasks are difficult for humans to perform given the location yet would be easily accessible for a small mobile robot. The robot propels itself using the sidewinding motion used by snakes on both land and in water.
