title:  "Nylon Polymerization"
---

Polymerization is the process by which small molecules called _monomers_ link together to form long chains called _polymers_. The polymer chains can be indefinitely long and are limited only by the availability of reactants.  
  
Nylon is formed by combining sebacoyl chloride (in carbon tetrachloride) with hexamethyldiamine (in water). At the interface between the non-mixing solutions, the molecules combine to form the polymer nylon. Slowly pulling the material out of the container allows for new polymer to be continuously formed as the reaction proceeds.
