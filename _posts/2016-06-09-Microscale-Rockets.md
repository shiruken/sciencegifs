title:  "Microscale Rockets"

Each one of these microscopic cylindrical tubes is roughly 10 microns in length and chemically propelled like a space-faring rocket. They draw in fuel from the surrounding environment, which reacts with the catalysts coating the interior to produce gases (oxygen). These resulting gases bubble out the rear of the microrocket, creating thrust capable of propelling the tubes at more than 1000 body-lengths/second.  
  
Researchers have already demonstrated the ability to haul cargo with these tiny rockets and hope to one day use them to precisely deliver drugs and isolate cancer cells.
