title:  "Pyrex Shattering at 343,000fps"
---

Pyrex is a popular household glassware company that is famous for making
sturdy measuring cups and containers out of _borosilicate glass_. However,
after Corning sold the Pyrex brand in 1998, the borosilicate glass was
substituted for weaker _tempered soda-lime glass_ in the United States. While
it is arguably more resilient to drops, the soda-lime glass does not handle
temperature shock as well as borosilicate glass. Exposing a hot glass to a
cold surface, such as a wet granite countertop, can often result in the glass
violently shattering.  
  
The Slow Mo Guys demonstrate this problem using their ultra high-speed cameras
and a blowtorch. After heating the handle of a Pyrex measuring cup with the
flame it shatters into pieces after being sprayed with water. In order to
capture the fracturing of the glass, they had to record the footage at over
343,000 frames-per-second (13,000x faster than the human eye can see) at a
resolution of 256x144. Out of the 5.1 seconds of recorded footage, the handle
shattering only occupied 0.000104 seconds.
