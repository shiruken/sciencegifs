title:  "Making Sodium Chloride"
---

Sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, is a notoriously inert substance. However, its constituent elements, sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl), are both extremely reactive and dangerous. The reaction between the two is highly exothermic and results in a cloud of sodium chloride smoke.  
  
In this demonstration, the glass container is filled with chlorine gas. Sodium metal is heated over a Bunsen burner and submerged into the gas to initiate the reaction.
