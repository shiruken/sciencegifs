title:  "Neutron Star Merger"
---

On August 17th, a **gravitational wave** was detected by the US-based _LIGO_ and European-based _VIRGO_ observatories. A couple seconds later, NASA 's _Fermi_ space telescope picked up a pulse of high-energy gamma-ray radiation from the constellation Hydra. Astronomers across the planet were notified of the event and over the next few days, hundreds of telescopes turned their eyes towards a galaxy located 130 million light-years from Earth.  
  
For the first time ever, scientists have detected gravitational waves and light generated as two **neutron stars** merged together. Neutron stars are the leftover cores of massive stars that exploded as supernovas long ago. They are the densest known objects in the Universe, squeezing a mass equivalent to that of the Sun into a sphere only a few miles in diameter.  
  
As the two neutron stars spiraled together, they shed energy in the form of spacetime-distorting gravitational waves. When they finally merged, an immense burst of gamma-ray radiation was expelled, a phenomenon long hypothesized by astrophysicists. The light from this **kilonova** was imaged by both Earth- and space-based telescopes for days after the event was first detected.
