The green dots are _Trojan Asteroids_ and occupy one of Jupiter 's two stable Lagrangian points located 60-degrees before and after the planet. The pink dots are _Hildian Asteroids_ that dynamically move between one of three positions directly opposite Jupiter or 60-degrees before and after the planet.
