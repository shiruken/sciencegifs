title:  "Laser-powered droplets"
---

Polypyrrole is a conducting polymer than can be manipulated using certain wavelengths of light. A water droplet coated in polypyrrole (the black dot) will bend depending on the angle of illumination. This bending can be used to steer the motion of the coated droplet.  
  
Here, the polypyrrole water droplet is being used to haul a load that weighs 150 times its weight across water. As the infrared laser illuminates the droplet, it causes motion in the opposite direction. However, because of the weight of the load, the droplet bursts from the force being applied by the laser.  
  
This technology has potential in medicine for the targeted delivery of drugs or insertion of tiny medical devices.
