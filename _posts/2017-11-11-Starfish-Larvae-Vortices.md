title:  "Starfish Larvae Vortices"
---

Scientists have created a simple algorithm called **flowtrace** for visualizing time-varying flow fields in biological samples. Here, the vortices created by a starfish larvae can easily be observed. Linear arrays of **cilia** surround the surface of the larvae to provide propulsion and aid in capturing prey. The coordinated motion of the ciliary bands produce complex fluid flow around the organism, which can be visualized using this new technique.
