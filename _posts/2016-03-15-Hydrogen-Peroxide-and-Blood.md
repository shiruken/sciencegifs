title:  "Hydrogen Peroxide and Blood"
---

Contrary to popular belief, the application of hydrogen peroxide to open wounds actually risks harming the surrounding tissue and slowing the healing process. This is because of the activity of an enzyme called _catalase_ , which is found in almost every cell in the human body.   
  
Catalase facilitates the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2) and is important in protecting cells from oxidative damage. Hydrogen peroxide is actually so dangerous to cellular life that almost all organisms that are exposed to oxygen have evolved a pathway to break it down.  
  
The formation of oxygen gas causes the blood to foam, which is why a direct injection of hydrogen peroxide would likely prove fatal. It is far safer and more effective to use soap and water when disinfecting open wounds.
